# napari-3D-registration roadmap

Priority from 1 (most important) to 5 (least important). The priorities are bound to evolve with time.

- [ ] Dataset test for time registration (1)
- [ ] Dataset test for spatial registration (1)
- [ ] Better interface for initial transformations (2)
- [ ] Better interface for running or not registration based on the computed transformations (2)
- [ ]
